      <h1>Reset Phase: Week 3</h1>
      <h2>What I learned in the week</h2>
      <time datetime="04-25-2022">Apr. 25, 2022</time>
      <h3>What I learned: Apr. 19-25, 2022 </h3>
      <h4>Everything is a remix </h4>
      <p>This ties in with what I learned last week that new ideas are born from older ideas. I think this is good because it allows us to create something from a base we already know. Remixing is actually how I get my coding done because through research on what other people have done I can apply it on my own problem and adapt it according to my needs. </p>
      <h4>Variable length code </h4> 
      <p>This week I learned what variable length code is. I found it very logical to use this to optimize how we assign patterns to our variables. And with this technique be able to compress and better organized our variable code.</p>
      <h4>Missing semester: Shell tools and scripting </h4>
      <p>I learned what shell scripts were and their differences with shell functions. Also, I learned about shell tools that can save you time googling things you don’t know. I think learning these tools will be useful so I don’t get distracted and follow a nice workflow. </p>
      <h4>#perfmatters </h4>
      <p>This gave me an idea on performance tool techniques. It showed me that tools aren’t rules and we can implement them as they fit our needs. Also, it gave me a deeper understanding on why sometimes webpages may feel slow and ways to change this. I think this is important in all senses of programming to better improve the performance and latency of our software. </p>
      <h4>The best programming language </h4>
      <p>When we choose a programming language there’s multiple criteria to keep in mind: productivity, performance, reliability, portability, community and what you already know. We as developers have to ask ourselves what we need from our program and which language fits the criteria better. We shouldn’t close ourselves off to a new language because we’ve never worked on it before, it could actually be the best fit for our project. </p>
      <h4>Agile mindset </h4>
      <p>I think that marking out that perfection isn’t realistic is very important for our projects. I think it’s really hard to get things done right the first time. I like the agile mindset because it says that it’s good to fail because these are opportunities for us to learn. I think this is very true because at least we rule out what doesn’t work.  </p>
      <p>Learned this from: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Perfection Is An Unrealistic Goal </li>
          <li>The Power of an Agile Mindset </li>
          <lil>Collaboration, Bonobos and The Brain </lil>
      </ul>
      <h4>Social Skills</h4>
      <p>I learned more about what it means to be a software engineer at a no technical level. If you want to be successful you have to have a good technical knowledge but you need to know how to be able to interact and communicate with people. This is easier in ideal environments but some companies may have toxic environments. And while this is awful, you can still do things to make yourself heard. </p>
      <p>Programming well with others means that you push aside the desire to not feel stupid, or get territorial with your code. Actually, admitting your mistakes and seeking help when needed can improve the workflow to a faster level. No one is a genius and we shouldn’t try to pretend we are that. Communication is what makes software teams successful. This week I realized how important communication and organization ourselves is, without it we wouldn’t accomplish anything. I was able to receive and give help because of communication. I feel that I need to improve but I do feel like I learned that our team shouldn’t feel like individuals and reach out for help when needed. </p>
      <p>Learned this from: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google I/O 2011: Programming Well with Others: Social Skills for Geeks    </li>
        <li>Google I/O 2009 - The Myth of the Genius Programmer </li>
        <li>Google I/O 2012 - The Art of Organizational Manipulation </li>
        <lil>Who do you Trust? </lil>
      </ul>
      <h4>Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep </h4>
      <p>I learned that there are various stages between being a novice and an expert in a skill. I think this will be helpful so I'm aware of what I need to do to level up my knowledge. It’s also good because it opened my eyes and showed me that people can’t be treated uniformly because we have different needs based on the stages, we’re on. This is actually a good thing because we know where we are and we know how we can move forward. It’s also good so we can take advantage of the intuition of experts, if we keep questioning and asking them to explain in detail their every move, we won’t be taking advantage of their skills. </p>
      <h4>The Passionate Programmer </h4>
      <p>This week I learned more on good execution and marketing myself. Good execution is important, which is why we have to constantly analyze ourselves and see if what we’re doing is helpful and ways in which we can be. Also, I learned that perception is crucial and it's how we are measured. We have to adapt ourselves to who we are talking to (customers, team members, etc.) so we can get our ideas across. This is something I feel I have issues with but now that I know these ties to the perception of ourselves, I'll try to make my communication more efficient. Similarly, a way to market ourselves is to build our brand and be remarkable. I’ll try to work on more personal projects that help me grow technically but also contributes to a field I'm interested in. </p>
      <h4>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </h4>
      <p>I finished the book <i>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.</i> This book taught me a lot of technical things that happen inside our computers. I learned a lot from binary numbers, to the minimum requirements for computers to work, low- and high-level languages, operating systems and much more. It helped me give me a general idea of what my computer uses to work and do the things I wish for. I think this can be helpful if something fails. Because now I have more knowledge of what the parts on my computer do and how they work.  </p>
      <h4>Learning how to learn </h4>
      <p>I finished this course and I was able to learn more about the way our brain works and why we turn to procrastination to seek temporary relief. Thanks to this I'll be able to realize when I'm losing focus and with the tools I learned, like the pomodoro technique, I'll be able to get back on track easily. I will try to implement metaphors to better learn what I'm studying because I feel that when I read my brain loses focus if there’s a long text. But with analogies and checking myself that I'm truly understanding, I think I can improve my way of learning and retain information more easily. Constantly checking that my metaphors make sense to me will help me retain the information but also, I can decide if an answer makes sense by looking at the big picture.  </p>
      <p>I think this course gave me a lot of mental tools to try and implement in my daily life. I don’t think I'll implement them all right now, I'll try to start small and keep building them up so I don’t become frustrated. However, I've been doing the pomodoro technique and it has helped to reduce my procrastination and actually get done the work that I'm not so excited about by focusing on the process (my 25-minutes focus time). The best thing about this course I think was that it gave me a real explanation of why cramming doesn’t work if you really want to learn. I’ve noticed before that building up ideas bit by bit was a firmer way to establish information in our brains but I didn’t know why it was like that. With this in mind, I’ll try to dedicate every day chunks of time to my desire subjects to learn so I can have a better understanding of them and improve myself in these fields. </p>
      <h4>Code Jam problems </h4>
      <p>Besides the more technical stuff of what I learned from coding in Java. I think what I learnt the most from these problems was that we as a team need to have good communication for all the work to be completed and to help each other out when needed. I think good communication will be crucial in further stages of the Apprentice program and in whatever work situation I find myself in. </p>
