            <h1>Reset Phase: Week 2</h1>
            <h2>What I learned in the week</h2>
            <time datetime="04-18-2022">Apr. 18, 2022</time>
            <h3>What I learned: Apr. 12-18, 2022 </h3>
            <h4>Creating a User-Based Recommender in 5 minutes </h4>
            <p>I learned how the Mahout Recommender works, I was able to use this for my Movie Recommender for this week’s assignment. However, what I think was most important from this was the learning it gave me to figure out which data is important for a specific method and that we may have to preprocess the data before we use any method. </p>
            <h4>Test Driven Development </h4> 
            <p>I learned that this methodology helps us to not code blindly, having tests from the beginning lets us catch mistakes and see if the approach we’re taking is the correct one or if we should change it.  </p>
            <h4>Unit Test </h4> 
            <p>With unit test we check if a small part of the code works, this will be helpful to implement because we can see if the issue is only at a specific point or if we need to change our whole approach. </p>
            <h4>Xunit </h4> 
            <p>I learned that depending on the language that we use the xUnit is different. For example, this week I used JUnit which allowed me to test my program in java. This was useful because I was able to test my program and see that it was actually working correctly. </p>
            <h4>Mocks Aren't Stubs </h4> 
            <p>I learned that there are different philosophies behind the Test-Driven Development: Classical TDD and Mockist TDD. I think I still need more practice to work out which one I fall under but it will be important to understand them so I can apply the one I’m most comfortable with. </p> 
            <h4>Java Build Tools: How Dependency Management Works with Maven, Gradle and Ant + Ivy </h4> 
            <p>This was useful because I was able to define dependencies on maven that helped me out with the problem of the week. I now know where dependencies should be added and this way I know if there’s one missing from my project. </p>
            <h4>Missing semester: Editors (Vim) </h4> 
            <p>I learned more about Vim, which can help me out in the future to read text files and programs from the console. I think this will be useful because there may be servers without a graphic interface.  </p>
            <h4>Missing semester: Version Control (Git) </h4> 
            <p>I learned more commands from Git. I think the one that was really useful for me this week was git commit because it let me store the changes in my code and I could look back on it if I did something wrong when I used git log. </p>
            <h4>Pale Blue Dot </h4> 
            <p>I reflected that our universe is really big, this is something that constantly impresses me. Although it’s something that’s in the back of my mind whenever I see pictures or comparisons with other planets or galaxies, I’m reminded of this fact. </p>
            <h4>The future of programming </h4> 
            <p>I think that only limiting yourself to one type of thinking is something very dangerous, this is something that can be hard to break out however because if it works, we don’t want to change it. Keeping a mindset that you don’t know what you’re doing is something that I want to do so I can be more open to new ideas that may be better than the ones I'm currently using.  </p>
            <h4>Inventing on principle </h4> 
            <p>What I learned was that experiences help us analyze ourselves. It’s important to try out different skills and ideas so we know if they’re useful, need improvement, or aren’t important at the moment. Making a principle is not something quick but different experiences may guide us to discover it. </p>
            <h4>Machine learning - google </h4> 
            <p>Making patterns is a key way for our brains to learn new things. Patter matching can improve the rate at which we learn immensely. Making a computer do the same with only input data can be very useful from a business perspective because it can show the users certain products that they’ll be more likely to buy. Also, with the pattern matching the computer may be able to identify dangerous paths but because the computer learned a similar solution to a similar problem at its training stage, now it knows what to do.  </p>
            <h4>Moonshot Thinking and Fast Company Exclusive: Inside Google X </h4> 
            <p>From here I was able to reflect on the value of failing. I think it’s something that we’re scared of, and even if we’re told that it’s ok and it’s the way to success, it’s still something that doesn’t sit right with us. I want to get better at accepting failure and to envision each failure as a step closer towards making something better.  </p>
            <h4>The best presentation of your life (La mejor presentación de tu vida)</h4> 
            <p>Here I learned tips that I want to apply for my presentations little by little, what I got is that adding things and improving ourselves is a sure way for our presentations to keep getting better and better. </p>
            <h4>What Got You Here Won't Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful</h4> 
            <p>The two takeaways I got where: I people don’t care for change don’t waste your time and following up feedback leads to consistent change. I’ll try to keep these two ideas present because I think they will help me grow personally and professionally. I think that trying to win an argument for the sake of it is something that can just hinder my growth. </p>
            <h4>Quantum physics and quantum computers</h4> 
            <p>Through all the material that related to quantum physics I was able to understand a bit more about how it is that it works. The double slit experiment helped me to comprehend the behavior of quantum particles and it was thanks to this that I had a clearer image of QUBITS. I think a lot of stuff went over my head and I definitely need to read more about the topic but I found it interesting that this field may open the doors for new computers so we humans aren’t physically restricted to new inventions. The leap to quantum computers may take a while though, but I see it as when we had big computers that took up a lot of space. Maybe in some years there’ll be a breakthrough and quantum computers may be the common thing to use. I liked this topic and I think it’s useful to learn more about it so we know how our devices work and have an idea of what we can ask of them and what limits they have, all this with the idea to keep improving.  </p>
            <p>Learned this from:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab   </li>
                <li>Dr Quantum - Double Slit Experiment </li>

                <li>The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don't Want You to Know</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Passionate Programmer </h4> 
            <p>I read chapter 2 and a little bit of chapter 3 (Tips 19-23) this week. From chapter 2 I learned more on investing in myself and why this is important. There were some fields that I could get better at that I hadn’t even thought about, like learning more about business. The beginning of chapter 3 is teaching me about actually having a good execution, the idea that sticks out to me the most is to do things right now. I’ll try to self-impose limits of time so I can actually be more productive and get things done early.  </p>
            <h4>Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</h4> 
            <p>This week I read chapter 9 through 16 and I learned a lot about the logic behind computers, how they’re able to do operations that seem simple like adding or subtracting and how they’re able to store values with a memory. Again, I think that learning more about what happens behind the scenes of a device we use every day helps us to better understand it. This can open our eyes and change our way of thinking. Instead of thinking, for example, that the computer can’t do addition and we need a new one, maybe all we need to do is clear up its memory. </p>
            <h4>Learning How to Learn</h4> 
            <p>I took the first two weeks of this course, and I think that it's helping me to better understand my brain. It helped me realize that our brains need balance, we can’t always be focused at learning, we have to let our brain rest otherwise we won’t be able to learn effectively. The methodologies that were exposed to me, like the pomodoro technique and chunking, are something that I want to do because I know that this way, I will be able to learn quickly and actually remember what I’m learning if I do them right. </p>
