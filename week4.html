      <h1>Reset Phase: Week 4</h1>
      <h2>What I learned in the week</h2>
      <time datetime="05-02-2022">May 2, 2022</time>
      <h3>What I learned: Apr. 26 - May 2, 2022 </h3>
      <h4>Great Explainers & Scientific Method</h4>
      <p>I learned that having a great mind doesn’t equal being a great explainer. If you ask me, I think knowing how to explain things is more important. Because if no one understands what you’re thinking of, you may be stuck on an idea forever. However, if other people understand you, you can bounce ideas back and forth and potentially come up with solutions together that you wouldn’t have thought of alone. </p>
      <p>Coming up with ideas is good, but we have to keep the scientific method in mind. At the end of the day, our ideas are guesses on how we think something will behave. If the experiment shows us otherwise, we should discard it and try other possibilities. We should be trying to guess the most likely explanation relying on the background information we know of the guess.  </p>
      <p>Learned this from: 
          <ul>
              <li>Richard Feynman, The Great Explainer: Great Minds </li>
              <li>TEDxCaltech - Tony Hey - Feynman and Computation </li>
              <li>TEDxCaltech - Danny Hillis - Reminiscing about Richard Feynman </li>
              <li>Feynman on Scientific Method</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>The Pretotyping Manifesto </h4>  
      <p>I learned that pretotyping is a very good way to test out if we have the right it before we build it. With the tested ideas of this week, I realized that having an idea is not always all it takes for your product to work. And that actually doing a pretotype can save you a lot of money and effort, because you can actually test if your idea is worth pursuing.  </p>
      <p>We tested three ideas, youu can read what results we got by clicking: <a href="pretotype.html"><u>here</u></a></p>
      <h4>Understanding the universe</h4>  
      <p>I learned to see the universe as a giant computer. It’s constantly processing information because every atom carries bits of information and when the atoms collide the bits flip and the universe computes. This is why quantum computers are possible because we’re already working with the existing computation of the universe.  </p>
      <p>Learned this from:
          <ul>
              <li>Seth Lloyd on Programming the Universe </li>
              <li>Seth Lloyd: Quantum Machine Learning </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Why We Should Have Your Own Black Box? </h4>  
      <p>I learned that having a growth mindset is a way to liberate our creative side, it lets us learn from our mistakes. I think that when you’re not scared of failing, we can be more open and committed to improving ourselves, our ideas, and our execution. </p>
      <h4>Software testing</h4>  
      <p>I learned that software testing is very important. It’s a way to prepare for more disastrous outcomes. If we break things on purpose, we can build more resilient systems. Now that web systems are growing more complex the systems failures have become difficult to predict. Designing to avoid failure is not enough and exhaustive testing is impossible. We need to stop waiting for random failure, if we see how our system fails, we can remove this uncertainty and actually come up with ways to improve our system. </p>
      <p>Learned this from:
        <ul>
            <li>Tools for Continuous Integration at Google Scale   </li>
            <li>Testing Engineering@Google & The Release Process for Google's Chrome for iOS </li>
            <li>GTAC 2014: I Don't Test Often ... But When I Do, I Test in Production </li>
            <li>GTAC 2014: Test coverage at Google </li>
            <li>GTAC 2014: The Testing User Experience</li>
            <li>Breaking Things at Netflix </li>
            <li>Chaos Engineering: the history, principles, and practice </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>The Passionate Programmer</h4>  
      <p>Overall, this book put into perspective the importance of improving areas we struggle with and investing in new areas that could help us in the market. I learned that complacency can equal to blind spots and this can greatly affect our work. We have to keep alert to see what else will come up next in the market. We also need a plan for our personal growth and adapt an agile process because change is necessary in this career. The most important thing right now for me I think is to be happy with small improvements. I don’t know if they’re happening fast enough, but I do feel myself improving, I have to keep on track so my improvement can be constant. </p>
