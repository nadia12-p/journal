      <h3>What I learned: July 5 - July 11, 2022 </h3>
      <h4>First Issue</h4>
      <p>This week I was able to finish one of the issues I started the previous week, the one where I redesign the <a href="https://github.com/dylan-power/dinosaur-exploder/issues/56"><u>pause menu</u></a>, you can look at my pull request <a href="https://github.com/dylan-power/dinosaur-exploder/pull/74"><u>here</u></a>. I struggled with this issue because at first, I didn’t understand how to access the pause menu to make the changes, but then I realized it came in the FXGL default methods so I overrode it and wrote my own pause menu. I think that helped me to understand better how we can work with and modify abstract classes in java.  </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Second Issue</h4>
      <p>From the other issue that I started last week; I made a solution from scratch because I couldn’t find where the previous code was. However, during revision of the PR (which you can find <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop/pull/2821"><u>here</u></a>) I got the feedback necessary to switch my code to the proper file. I think this taught me that it is really important to have files named with an easily readable name.  </p>
      <p>The file I was looking at was called rc.ts, which I'm assuming means ‘running commands’ but I didn’t know and from the description of the issue (which you can find <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop/issues/2582"><u>here</u></a>), I assumed there weren’t any flags or commands yet. So, I did my file and submitted the PR where I got more context on what they needed and how they wanted to implement it, and learn that some workarounds I did weren’t necessary.  </p>
      <p>I made some changes with the feedback I received, now I had things clearer on how the project worked than with only the documentation, where I couldn’t find how they ran their cli. I’m hoping the changes I made were correct and my PR gets merged soon, if not I'll keep modifying the code until it’s merged. </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Third Issue</h4>
      <p>For my third issue I worked on another issue of the Dinosaur Exploder, it was adding sounds to the background, you can find the issue <a href="https://github.com/dylan-power/dinosaur-exploder/issues/40"><u>here</u></a>. It was about adding sounds to the game. At first, I thought of using the FXGL.play() method because that’s how the sounds were implemented up until that point but the problem was that it doesn’t have a way to stop when you want to change views. Because I wanted to add a background sound for the home screen and pause it when you start the game so you could hear another background sound for the play screen. </p>
      <p>After some investigation, I finally realized that I needed to use the MediaPlayer and Media class from JavaFX, I got stuck here for a bit because some tutorial videos used methods that weren’t accessible, and I was trying to find if there was a method with the same functionality, I figured they only changed the name of the method. I was able to find it, and it worked fine. However, when trying to use the same approach for the background sound of the play screen I discovered that the sound effects of the game that used the FXGL.play() method would pause the play screen’s sound. I had to use FXGL.play() to solve this issue because through more research I found that this was an issue that didn’t have a solution (At least not one I found).  </p>
      <p>I did my PR after everything seemed ok, but had an issue while submitting it. One of the maintainers had updated the idea folder (but I didn’t know that) and thought I had deleted the files accidentally. I learned some ways to get files back that you delete when doing PR which I think are very important to know so I don’t panic if I actually delete something by mistake and I can restore the changes.  </p>
      <h4>Performance Interview</h4>
      <p>Also, I’ve started studying for my performance interview. I studied data structures and learned the differences between arrays and lists, and how they’re implemented on Java. I also learned about queues, stacks, hashtables, trees and graphs. I learned when it’s best to implement an array/list, because of the way they’re stored in the memory.  </p>
      <p>I reviewed programming paradigms and why they’re useful. I studied object-oriented programming, and I reviewed some concepts like object, class, method, the pillars of OOP, etc. But through this revision it was clear to me the differences between an abstract class and an interface and how each one is implemented.  </p>
      <p>Also, I learned about the SOLID principles, I think the first four principles I can explain and understand with no problem, but I have to review the last principle (dependency injection) because I have trouble explaining it. </p>
