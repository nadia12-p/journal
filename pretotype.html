      <h1>Pretotype Technique</h1>
      <h2>May 2, 2022</h2>
      <time datetime="05-02-2022">By: Nadia Pintos, Ivan Gamboa and Ana Castillo</time>
      <h3>Plant Watering technique</h3>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>We thought of a device you could put in your pot and through an app you can tell the size and type of plant you have. This will tell the device when it has to water it and you can be reminded of this by a message to your phone when the device detects the plant needs watering. </p>
      <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
      <p>Remembering when plants need to be watered can be a difficult task for busy people; the majority of the participants, 5 out of 7 at least, would like a plant watering alarm.  </p>
      <h4>Experiment description </h4>
      <p>Participants of the experiment: 7. We brought some painted small cardboard boxes to people with houseplants. We told them they were devices that could read if their plants needed more water. We instructed them to put them in their pots and waited a bit and then sent them a message telling them their plants needed watering. </p>
      <h4>Validation</h4>
      <p>After the experiment was done, we sent them a link to answer a feedback questionnaire. Here we could validate if they’re interested in the device, what they thought of it, and whether they had extra comments on the experiment and device. </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>3 out of 7 (42.9%) participants were really sure about wanting the device. Although most participants, 5 out of 7 (71.4%) thought it was a good idea, they wouldn’t use the product as is. The main concern was that with multiple plants the price could elevate quickly. Although, many like the concept because they have different plants and keeping track of their watering schedules on top of their jobs can be a bit hard. The hypothesis didn’t reach its goal and this idea will be rejected for now. However, these comments could be useful for a second experiment if the idea wants to be tested further.  </p>

      <h3>Meme Finder</h3>
      <h4>Idea</h4>
      <p>Memes are a resource widely used today in social networks, it is easy to share ideas or feelings through them, but it is not always easy to find the correct image or the one we are thinking of, that is why a meme search engine is necessary to facilitate this process </p>
      <h4>Keys</h4>
      <p>People don’t find the memes when they want.</p>
      <p>People are willing to open a new page or app to find memes.</p>
      <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
      <p>We think that when people try to search for a meme, they use Google images for that. So, using a tool outside the chat or social network is not a problem. We believe that more than 80% of people are willing to use our pretotype because they feel identified </p>
      <h4>Experiment description </h4>
      <p>For the experiment, we created a simple form in Google Forms simulating a search engine (text box and button), then asked in a group of 480 people if they felt identified with the idea and that they were free to simulate a search in the form. </p>
      <h4>Validation</h4>
      <p>The hypothesis is rejected since very few interested took the time to test the simulation, although the vast majority of interested we think it is a great idea. </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>From the 480 people who were in the group, only 40 people see and showed interest, of those 40 people 38 indicated they had the problem before, however only 11 people took the time to try the pretotype, this means that only 28% of people they would use a new application for this purpose. With the great interest in the idea and the little participation, it is possible that our way of introducing the simulation was not the best, or that people are not interested in using an application for that purpose. </p>
     
      <h3>Reminder for taking pills </h3>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>The elderly (people over the age of 80) usually have to take a lot of medications, and because of their advanced age, they tend to forget when to take their medications or if they have already taken them. Tools like alarms in the phone aren’t that effective because elderly don’t usually have phones, and if they do, they don’t necessarily have them with them all the time. Also, having so many options on the screen often confuses them. </p>
      <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
      <p>A gadget, similar to a smart watch, but only for reminding the user when to take her pills, would be more helpful, because it doesn’t have many apps causing distraction and would be with the user all the time. </p>
      <h4>Experiment description </h4>
      <p>The users wore a bracelet with a piece of cardboard with two “buttons”. One for adding a new medicine and one for seeing a calendar. </p>
      <p>For adding a new medicament, the users pretended to take a photo of the container of the pills, indicated the dose and then selected the days and hours for setting the alarm, all of this on a cardboard display. When the alarm would go off, I would display this information for them on another piece of cardboard (the photo was actually a drawing). </p>
      <p>The calendar (another piece of cardboard that I would place on top of the gadget) showed the current date with the pills that had to be taken and the corresponding hours. If a medicine had already been taken, it was written in green. The missing pills were written in gray. </p>
      <p>Each time a new medicament was “added”, I would set an alarm on my phone so I could tell them when to take the pills. The gadget then would have an option for turning off the alarm and an option for marking the pill as already taken. If 10 minutes passed and the users hadn’t taken the pills yet, then the alarm would go off again, and so on until they would push the “already taken” button, so I could turn off the alarm. </p>
      <h4>Validation</h4>
      <p>The hypothesis is rejected, since users have yet to be reminded of taking a device with them all the time. We better take the time for taking care of our elderly. </p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>Although the users understood the interface and how the gadget had to be used, they took off the bracelet every time they had to do things like washing the dishes, taking showers or going to sleep, and often forgot to wear the bracelet again, so if the bracelet was in a different room, the same thing as with the phone would happen; they wouldn’t be able to hear the alarm. </p>
