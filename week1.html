      <h1>Reset Phase: Week 1</h1>
      <h2>What I learned in the week</h2>
      <time datetime="04-11-2022">Apr. 11, 2022</time>
      <h3>What I learned: Apr. 5-11, 2022 </h3>
      <h4>Missing semester: the linux shell </h4>
      <p>This week I learned a bit about computer terminals. It was a bit confusing but it actually helped me out when I was trying to create my journal on GitHub because at least I had a bit of an idea of what the commands in the tutorial meant when I was creating my blog. I knew that you could create documents directly from the shell but I didn’t know that you could assign the information from one existing document to another.  </p>
      <h4>X workflow </h4>
      <p>I learned some diagrams or structures to better organize the ideas I have to solve a problem. It also made me remember the importance of defining a problem correctly, because sometimes you lose sight of what the problem was in the first place and try to solve everything. Defining the problem helps reduce this issue. Also, it gives you a clearer idea of what you actually need to investigate to solve it. What I also found interesting was the importance of prototyping, I think that testing out things first can save us time later on and can also push us into the right direction to solve our problem. Finally, what I thought the most important thing in this article was the idea of future improvements. Sometimes we get lazy and do not record what we do but maybe in the future we can have a problem that we’ve already solved. It's also good so we know when we fail, maybe in the future we’ll come up with different tools or technologies to actually be able to implement that idea.  </p>
      <h4>Lighting talks: network protocols </h4>
      <p>This week the topic I chose was network protocols. I knew a bit about them before but I think that while I was investigating, I learned more about their vulnerabilities. I found this very interesting because I knew people attacked other people’s computers and stole sensitive data but I didn’t know how they were capable of that. I'm not an expert but this research helped me be more aware of why cybersecurity is important, especially if we use the internet daily.  </p>
      <h4>Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</h4>
      <p>I read chapter 1 through 8 from <i>Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware & Software</i> and I learned to better visualize the binary language. This book gave a lot of examples like morse code, electric circuits, the telegraph, etc. that are based on a two-based system. I learned about the history and rules of these communication methods but what I liked the most was that they gave a visual representation of how binary digits work. I think that without this introduction I would have really struggled to understand the binary numbers, how to add them, multiply them, convert them from binary to decimal or decimal to binary. Now, though, I think I have a better understanding of how they work because the book showed us how different number systems count. Without these examples, jumping from the decimal system to the binary system would have been very confusing for me.  </p>
      <h4>The Passionate Programmer</h4>
      <p>I also read chapter 1 of <i>The Passionate Programmer</i>, which gave me 10 tips on how to be a better software developer. I think what I found most interesting was the idea of being a generalist. I think it goes hand in hand with investing in your intelligence and trying to learn as much as you can. From all that I've been reading and watching this week I think that knowing how to learn things is the most important skill that a developer can have.  </p>
      <h4>Day 18: Queues and stacks </h4>
      <p>With HackerRank, I learned the concept of queues and stacks. I like how the tutorial video explained it because I was able to visualize it strongly. And when I did the code, it helped me out to draw the string like a queue and stack so I know what I was comparing. I think these structures may be useful to solve future problems.  </p>
      <h4>Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence</h4>
      <p>I learned that humans are eventually put in the same boat and the way to keep afloat is by cooperating with each other. I found it interesting that the second level of humans, and the best, is called the sacred level. But now that I reflect on it, ideas are such powerful things that to try and break someone out of one that’s very deeply rooted in their system is like insulting their god. I like what Haidt says about people fighting together to defend an idea, the thing that I guess scares me is how to know to follow the good ideas. This video gave me more to reflect on human behavior and how we find a purpose within ourselves.  </p>
      <h4>Creative Thinking Hacks  </h4>
      <p>What I think was most important for me from the <i>Creative Thinking Hacks</i> video is to record our ideas. With this we can have a way to check if something that failed at first can actually succeed with an idea we came up with later. Also, I also thought it was important to stop the myth that brilliant ideas come out of nowhere and are perfect from the get go. I like that Berkun makes an emphasis on that everyone fails and everyone gets stuck. The hacks that he gives: doing prototypes, keeping a journal, taking enough risks, etc. are something that I'll try to do so I can get my creativity working.  </p>
      <h4>How progress really happens: leading the human side of change</h4>
      <p>I learned why people are opposed to change. I think that we should be more open to change though, some embarrassment or extra work may be well worth the reward we may gain from the change. I think that analyzing traditions is something that should be done without prejudice, situations change and maybe traditions need to be changed too.  </p>
      <h4>Making badass developers</h4>
      <p>What I liked the most about the <i>Making Badass Developers</i> video was the cognitive resource management. It's something I'll try to implement to upgrade my skills. Sierra says we have to divide our skills into three columns:  </p>

         <p id="my-column">  A. Can't do (but need to) --- B. Can do with effort --- C. Mastered </p>

       <p> But from here we can run into some problems: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem 1 - Things don't get better (pile up on B) </li>
                <li>Problem 2 - The intermediate blues (half assed skills in C)</li>
                <li>Problem 3 - Takes too damn long (slow process) </li>
            </ul>
       <p> To fix each one we can do the following: </p>

         <ol>
           <li>Keep more on A, Split B into subskills </li>
           <li>Revisit skills on C </li>
           <li>Bypass B where we can, speed up A and B</li>
         </ol>    

       <p> A crucial thing is pattern matching, our brain can have a quick notion of things being right or wrong if it has 
        patterns to match. The key for this is to do high quality, very high quantity, examples.
      </p>
      <h4>Peak: how to master anything</h4>
      <p>What I learned from <i>Peak: How to master anything</i> was how important mental representations are. They are the key to having good deliberate practice and actually improving in whatever project you’ve been working on. Having a designated time where we can have purposeful practice is the best way to learn new things and breakthrough limits that we’ve established before.  </p>
      <h4>Ideas are just a multiplier of execution </h4>
      <p>Also, I learned that even if we have a brilliant idea but we don’t execute it then we can’t gain anything from it. Also putting too much effort into a bad idea can cost you a lot of time and resources. You need to multiply great ideas and great executions if you want to do business.  </p>
      <h4>How to talk to anyone  </h4>
      <p>This week I was able to learn more about conversational skills. It's something that I definitely have a hard time on so this reading was very reflective. It inspired me and gave me ideas of areas I have to work on and tips to improve. The most important learnings that I got:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>First impressions are important and there’s more to it than just what you talk about. 
            Physical cues and actions are also important</li>
          <li>Tips on how to start and continue great small talk. If you want to make the other person comfortable, 
            or you want them to care about what you have to say, small talk is absolutely necessary.</li>
          <li>To not to sound arrogant or a jerk, a conversation needs balance. You need to listen to what the other person has to say. </li>
          <li>Getting inside a crowd can be done with a bit of research. Come prepared so you have something to talk about</li>
          <li>Tips on how to make other people think you’re equals; this can open more doors for you and your proposals may be heard more if you have a connection with the other person you’re communicating with </li>
          <li>How to modulate your voice or gestures. Quirks that will put people at ease when they’re communicating with you.</li>
          <li>Treat every party, meeting, call as a rehearsal. You don’t know when the most important conversation of your life may happen.</li>
          <li>Overlook the bloopers of whoever you’re communicating with So they don’t feel embarrassed.</li>
          <li>How to ask for favors from other people so it feels like it’s done out of friendship. This may be the case sometimes, 
            but well sometimes you know you want them to do you a favor for you at a later time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What are the most profound life lessons from Stanford professor John Ousterhout? </h4>
        <p>I was able to reflect on why relationships fail and what we can do to prevent them from falling apart. </p>  
      <ul>
        <li>It’s really hard to build relationships that last for a long time </li>
        <li>Relationships fail because of an accumulation of little things (professor Ousterhout calls them scar tissues) that build up over time and explode in a catastrophic event towards the end of the relationship.</li>
        <li>Due to these scar tissues people start to become sensitive and they expect bad behavior. This will grow and grow until the tipping point where the relationship will fall apart. </li>
        <li>If you want relationships to last a long time, whenever there is an issue, you have to solve it so none of the people involved will have lingering animosity or resentment. </li>
        <li>The key is communication and compromise. Both sides need to understand the other’s point of view and be willing to compromise to achieve a solution That is fair for both of them.</li>
        <li>Classic mistakes: being too nice. Whenever you have an issue, vocalize it.Also, trying to always win an argument is a sure way for scar tissue to grow and fracture your relationship.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Autopilot Brain</h4>
      <p>
        I learned that humans have developed an unconscious decision-making system to keep our brains from overloading. 
        I think I definitely fall under the passenger archetype. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with so much information that 
        I numb it all and keep going without actually processing anything. Some tips like prioritizing my to-do list are 
        something that I've been trying to implement in my life for a couple of weeks and I think it does help me to focus on 
        what I need to do and not just get carried away. I will try out the other tip the reading gave me: Trying out new 
        things is something that sometimes I struggle with but find I almost always like it when I actually give myself 
        time to do it. 
        Also, I learned that modern life puts people under three key pressures: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>We are too busy to notice what decisions we make. </li>
          <li>Tech makes us sleepwalk into our choices. </li>
          <li>We compare ourselves to impossible standards. </li>
        </ol>
 
      <p>These three pressures are something that I've recently become aware of. I've been trying to make a conscious effort 
        to not let myself be dragged down by what I see on social media and what other people think is success. At the end of 
        the day, you define your own happiness. I like that this part of the reading addresses these problems and I’ll try to 
        make a conscious effort to give time to the things that really matter to me and not whatever expectations may be pushed 
        on my feed.
