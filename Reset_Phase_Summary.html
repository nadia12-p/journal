      <h1>Reset Phase</h1>
      <h2>What I learned in the phase</h2>
      <time datetime="05-02-2022">Apr. 5 - May 2, 2022</time>
      <h3>Reset Phase learnings</h3>
      <p>I realized that it’s alright to not know a lot of things, as long as you learn quickly. I think that this reset phase puts into perspective the need for executing our ideas and planning for the future. We need a plan; we need to execute and learn from the feedback we get. Learning can also be seen through this lense, we make a plan for what we want to learn, we apply our knowledge overtime and we get feedback so we know when we can or cannot use it. And where are the fields in our knowledge that need further improvement. Practicing is very important, and quick failures will help us grow quicker. The point is to keep testing things out and see where we can improve. </p>
      <p>Also, with the movie recommender test code that we had to do, I learned what tests were and how they can help to check that our code is working correctly. I’ve never used techniques like this before, and I struggled to understand what I had to do in the first place, but after a while I saw their importance and believe that it’s a good way to know what method or class is giving us issues. And on a bigger scale, with distributed systems, testing deliberate failures can eliminate uncertainties and is the key to improving our systems. </p>
      <p>When we were working on the 20 pull requests, I learned a lot on how communication is crucial if we want the project to be completed. Also, I learned that understanding the problem is more important than knowing what programming language you’re using. At the end of the day, they’re tools and you can learn how they work. But if you don’t even know what you’re supposed to do, you’ll run into bigger problems.  </p>
      <p>I learned a lot from the books that we were assigned to read. From the Passionate Programmer I learned that we have to keep improving ourselves continuously. And from Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software I learned more on what goes on behind a computer. All the physical and software needs a simple computer needs, it gave me an idea on why some things are limited and why we can’t do certain things. I think that they were important to balance out how we should be while doing our job and to give us a technical background on things that aren’t so easily known. </p>
